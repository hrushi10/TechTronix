# TechTronix â€“ Java E-Commerce Website

TechTronix is a simple full-stack e-commerce web app I built using **Java Servlets, JSP, and MySQL**.  
It follows the **MVC architecture** and was deployed on **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** with the database hosted on **Amazon RDS**.

The goal of this project was to design a basic online shopping system with separate user and admin functionality, applying everything I learned about web programming, databases, and deployment in Java.

## What I Learned
This project helped me understand how Java web applications work end-to-end:
- How **Servlets and JSP** communicate through controllers and views  
- Structuring a project using **MVC and DAO patterns**  
- Hosting a Java web app on **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**  
- Managing connections with **RDS** and configuring environment variables  
- Debugging deployment and database issues in the cloud

## Future Improvements
- Add email notifications for orders  
- Implement password encryption and validation  
- Replace JSP with a modern frontend (React or Angular)  
- Add payment gateway integration
